# fkinematics
A short matlab program to compute the forward kinematics given the D-H parameters of a robot. 

After seeing how tedious it is to deduce the forward kinematics expressions for the PUMA 560 robot, I was inspired to write this program that provides the required transforms between any two joint axes. 

I plan to introduce symbolic variables so that the output is given as a function of all the joint variables.
